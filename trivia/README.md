trivia dojo
===========

This repo is a copy (not a clone) of @jbrains's
"trivia game":https://github.com/jbrains/trivia repo, and was created with a specific challenge in mind:

The game has a bug, in that only 5 players can play (despite it appearing to be a 6-player game).
So the challenge is to get the failing test to pass. Simple.
